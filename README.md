# SwapCpp
I am trying to remake my game Swap! in C++ and I am suffering. Gameplay build available for Windows (I don't know how to build for Linux from a Windows machine).

This game needs playtest, so feel free to download SwapCpp 0.8.zip and play it. I especially need to know if there are issues with the undo button.

To play further, you can edit the .json files in levels/level001 to make other levels if you're brave enough but it's easy to write wrong stuff.
